        <ul>
          <li>
            Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It
            can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming
            platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behavior, aimed at
            scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted.

          <li>
            Examples include: spreading lies about or posting embarrassing
            photos or videos of someone on social media, and sending hurtful,
            abusive or threatening messages, images or videos via messaging
            platforms
          </li>

        When bullying happens online it can feel as if you’re being attacked
        everywhere, even inside your own home. It can seem like there’s no
        escape. The effects can last a long time and affect a person in many
        ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mentally - feeling upset, embarrassed, stupid, even afraid or angry
        </li>
        <li>
          Emotionally - feeling ashamed or losing interest in the things you
          love
        </li>
        <li>
          Physically - tired (loss of sleep), or experiencing symptoms like
          stomach aches and headaches
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="cb-main-2-content-p2">
        The feeling of being laughed at or harassed by others, can prevent
        people from speaking up or trying to deal with the problem. In extreme
        cases, cyberbullying can even lead to people taking their own lives.
